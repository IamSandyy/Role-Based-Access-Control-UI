# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Role-Based-Access-Control-UI
This project is a simple web application for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It lets you manage users and roles with different permissions.
RBAC User Interface
**Overview**
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage users, roles, and permissions through an admin interface. It allows administrators to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users and roles, while dynamically assigning permissions. The UI is designed using React and Bootstrap for responsiveness and ease of use.

**Features**
_User Management:
_
View a list of users with their roles and statuses (Active/Inactive).
Add, edit, and delete users.
Assign roles to users and manage their statuses.
_Role Management:_

View a list of roles and their associated permissions.
Add, edit, and delete roles.
Assign permissions (Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes to roles.
Dynamic Permissions:

Assign permissions to roles and users dynamically.
Easily manage permissions through the user-friendly interface.
Responsive Design:

The UI is built with Bootstrap to ensure that it works well on different screen sizes and devices.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React-Bootstrap: Bootstrap components implemented in React.
JavaScript (ES6+): For frontend logic.
HTML5 & CSS3: Basic structure and styling.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive design.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download Node.js from here.
A text editor or IDE like VSCode or Sublime Text.
Steps to Set Up the Project

Navigate to the project directory:
cd rbac-ui
Install the required dependencies:
npm install
Start the development server:

npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

How to Use
_User Management:_

Click the "Add User" button to create a new user.
Use the "Edit" button next to each user to modify their details (name, role, and status).
Use the "Delete" button to remove a user from the list.
_Role Management:_

Click the "Add Role" button to create a new role.
Use the "Edit" button next to each role to modify the role's name or permissions.
Use the "Delete" button to remove a role.
**Future Enhancements**
Authentication & Authorization: Implement authentication and restrict access based on roles.
Search & Filter: Add search functionality to filter users and roles.
API Integration: Replace mock data with actual API calls for managing users and roles.
Advanced Permission Control: Introduce more granular permission settings for specific features.
