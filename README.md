# Role-Based-Access-Control-UI
This project is a simple web application for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It lets you manage users and roles with different permissions.
RBAC User Interface
**Overview**
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage users, roles, and permissions through an admin interface.

The UI is designed using React and Bootstrap for responsiveness and ease of use.

Responsive Design:

The UI is built with Bootstrap to ensure that it works well on different screen sizes and devices.
